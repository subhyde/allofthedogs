                This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, All of the dogs collects
                non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                and time of each visitor request. All of the dogs’s purpose in
                collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
                understand how All of the dogs’s visitors use its website. From
                time to time, All of the dogs may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
                by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the dogs also collects potentially personally-identifying
                information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
                users and for users leaving comments on http://allofthedogs.com
                blog posts. All of the dogs only discloses logged in user and
                commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
                and discloses personally-identifying information as described
                below.
            </p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>
                Certain visitors to All of the dogs’s websites choose to
                interact with All of the dogs in ways that require All of the
                dogs to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
                and type of information that All of the dogs gathers depends on
                the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
                sign up for a blog at http://allofthedogs.com to provide a
                username and email address.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>

                Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
